I expect this course to teach me all about web development. I hope I learn many things that will surely help me as I go into this journey of learning how to build web applications which are very essential in today's world. I also hope I get to have fun as I gain new experiences. I am very much hoping for a very enjoyable and insightful laboratory class.
